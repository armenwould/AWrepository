  <p><center><i>What does the frequency map look like after all is said and done?</i></center></p>
  
  <p>This is the first file, NOISE.wav. It comes with the package and is the base of the noise that you're creating.<br>

  <p>This is the second file, NOISE_INITIAL.wav. This is NOISE.wav but with the initial hi-pass filter applied to it based on the input of the user. This example has the cutoff at 0,9kHz.<br>

  </p>
  
  <p>This is the third file, NOISE_ADDITIONAL.wav. This is the first bandpass that is added to the NOISE_INITIAL.wav file, based on the input of the user. This example has the lower cutoff at 1,3kHz and the upper cutoff at 1,4kHz.<br>

  </p>
  
  <p>This is the fourth file, NOISE_ADDITIONAL2.wav. This is the second bandpass that is added to the NOISE_INITIAL.wav file, based on the input of the user. This example has the lower cutoff at 4kHz and the upper cutoff at 5kHz.<br>

  <p>This is the fifth file, NOISE_ADDITIONAL3.wav. This is the third bandpass that is added to the NOISE_INITIAL.wav file, based on the input of the user. This example has the lower cutoff at 8kHz and the upper cutoff at 9kHz.<br>

  <p>This is the sixth file, combo1and2.wav. This file is the combination of NOISE_INITIAL.wav and NOISE_ADDITIONAL.wav.<br>
