  <h3>Misophonia</h3>
  
  <p>
    <a href="https://www.webmd.com/mental-health/what-is-misophonia"> Misophonia </a> is a 
    rare psychological disorder that afflicts less than 200 000 people in the United States. 
    Derived literally from Greek, "miso" is hatred of and "phonia" is sound. People afflicted
    with this disorder have a peculiar sensitivity to certain sounds. When exposed to these sounds,
    the most common of which are chewing, lip smacking, pencil tapping, and yawning, the afflictant
    usually experiences the following:
  </p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>anxiety</li>
    <li>discomfort</li>
    <li>the urge to flee</li>
    <li>disgust</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>
    Or, if the condition is more severe:
  </p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>rage</li>
    <li>anger</li>
    <li>panic/panic attacks</li>
    <li>fear</li>
    <li>emotional distress</li>
    <li>a desire to kill or stop that which is producing the sound</li>
    <li>skin crawling</li>
    <li>suicidal thoughts</li>
  </ul>
    
  <h3>Misophonia's Impact</h3>
    
    <p>
      Unfortunately, I have Misophonia. The disorder has negatively affected my life in many ways. 
      Namely, I cannot eat with people, go to the movies (popcorn is a very noisy snack), be in a
      quiet room, or even chew with my tongue (I can hear the noises I make as well). The only way I
      can combat this is to wear headphones almost every minute of the day so that I don't have a 
      panic attack. I have a very severe form of Misophonia, and as those who have studied it will say
      it only gets worse with time, because of the nature of the disorder. I can confirm this to be 
      the case; since I developed it four years ago the range of sounds that bother me has been growing
      at an alarming rate. I used to be able to eat with people with headphones on, but now I can't even
      see people eat without feeling nauseous at the least.
<br><br>
      Because of this worrying rate of growth, I decided to take it upon myself to figure out a solution.<br>
      The term Misophonia is only 2 months older than I (coined on June 18, 2001), so research on it is extremely
      limited. Currently, the only way people can cope is to either flee the stimulus or get therapy. Obviously,
      this isn't ideal. If I could devise a program that could target the frequencies and it ends up working,
      it would be a tremendous help to me, and those who are also afflicted. Perhaps this could be the next 
      stride in aids for misophoniacs!
